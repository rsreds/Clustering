# Clustering
Log clustering script for my thesis @CNAF

### cluster_creator.py
main script

Opens log file as pandas dataframe and clusterize the message based on the defined similarity and threshold

### clusters distribution.py
Plots the number of log lines as a function of times for all the files specified in file list

Labels must be the same size and should match with the similarity threshold

Plots the mean cluster variance for each file
